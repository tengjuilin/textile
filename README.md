# TEXTILE (Tutorials for EXperimenTalist Interactive LEarning) in Data Science

Tutorials and modules for teaching experimentalists data science from a biological perspective.

## Description

As a lab filled with experimentalists, the Nance Lab uses data science to enhance our abilities to understand biological data. We need an effective way to train our experimentalists to use data science methods and tools that are most applicable to our work. We have created approachable and accessible modules to teach data science from a biological perspective.
